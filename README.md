# Let's encrypt simp_le docker container with automated certificates renewal

Based on [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org), [simp_le](https://github.com/kuba/simp_le), [simp_le Docker container](https://github.com/m3adow/docker-letsencrypt-simp_le).

## Setup

To automated renewal you need, that container will be accessible at domain, which will be certificate get.

If you use nginx (in docker or native) it is simple

```
server {
  server_name example.com;

  location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9002;
  }
}
```

In multi-frontend environment, you need to specify exactly ip or host of docker server with container

```
proxy_pass http://<ip or hostname of docker server with container>:9002;
```

If you are using consul DNS it is simple

```
proxy_pass http://simp_le.service.consul:9002;
```

## Configuration

Configuration - is a set of files (one config file - one certificate) like

```
example.com,www.example.com
nginx1,nginx2
```

First line - comma separated domains list.

Second line - comma separated conatainers list to reload, if certificates was renewed. May be empty.

Files must be saved with any names in /etc/simp_le-auto.d/ (or any other location, mounted with -v to /etc/simp_le-auto.d/ in container).

## Run

```
docker run -itd -e "EMAIL=mail@example.com" -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /etc/simp_le/:/etc/simp_le/ -v /etc/simp_le-auto.d/:/etc/simp_le-auto.d/ kaktuss/letsencrypt-simp_le-auto
```

Here

EMAIL environment variable is Let's Encrypt account email.

Certificates will be saved in /etc/simp_le/ with domain-specific names.

```
cert_example.com.pem   chain_example.com.pem   key_example.com.pem
```

## Extended confiruration with environment variables

CERTS_DIR=/etc/simp_le/ - if you change certificates location, you need also change "-v" option that point to new location.

LISTEN_PORT=9002 - port, in which simp_le container will be listen verification requests.

SERVER_NAME=simp_le - name of container, to proxy_pass trow nginx, if you are using consul DNS.

DOCKER_SIMP_LE_ARGS - you can pass any args to docker command, that start simp_le container. As example: -e DOCKER_SIMP_LE_ARGS="-H 127.0.0.1:2875"

DOCKER_RUN_SIMP_LE_ARGS - you can pass any args to docker run command, that start simp_le container. As example: -e DOCKER_RUN_SIMP_LE_ARGS="--dns 8.8.8.8"
